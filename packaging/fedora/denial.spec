# Denial — Fedora source build adapter
#
# This spec builds Denial from the tagged Git source snapshot: %build runs the
# project's canonical pipeline (tools/denial-pc bootstrap +
# tools/stage-denial-runtime) inside the build chroot, compiling the Rust
# compositor with Cargo and the Flutter shell/settings bundles with the
# lock-pinned Denial Flutter fork. tools/stage-denial-runtime then stages the
# payload trees (denial/ and denial-flutter-engine/) that %install consumes,
# byte for byte.
#
# Everything is compiled in the chroot: tools/denial-pc bootstrap fetches the
# lock-pinned Flutter/Skia fork and toolchains, then
# tools/stage-denial-runtime drives the engine's gn/ninja build (Chromium
# bullseye sysroot, see the pkg-config shim below) and the Cargo and CMake
# phases. The denial-flutter-engine subpackage declared below ships the
# resulting libflutter_engine.so, so a single spec reproduces both packages
# and no prebuilt engine generation is needed at build time.
#
# %prep restores a minimal Git repository over the extracted snapshot so the
# project's own staging tool (which pins the release tag and refuses a dirty
# checkout) can identify the exact source.

%description
Denial owns the Wayland desktop scene, shell, motion, and composition using
Flutter as part of the compositor foundation.

This spec builds the compositor, shell, and settings bundles from the tagged
Git source snapshot and compiles the lock-pinned Flutter engine from the fork
sources in the chroot; the denial-flutter-engine subpackage ships the
resulting, SHA-256-verified libflutter_engine.so.

%description -n denial-flutter-engine
Source-built Flutter Engine generation coupled to Denial's embedder ABI. The
generation is pinned by SHA-256 in the Denial source tree; this package ships
the verified artifact, and the denial package links and bundles against it.

tools/denial-pc bootstrap

# The engine compiles against a prebuilt Debian bullseye sysroot
# (chrome-linux-sysroot, installed by a gclient hook during the engine
# checkout inside tools/stage-denial-runtime). gn's pkg_config() template
# (engine/src/build/config/linux/pkg_config.gni) runs pkg-config.py, which
# points PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR at the sysroot's .pc directories and then
# executes the bare `pkg-config` from PATH. On RHEL-family hosts the
# multilib pkg-config wrapper (or any fallback to the chroot's own .pc
# files) resolves glib & co from the Fedora layout (libdir=/usr/lib64),
# whose libdir-relative include directories (e.g. /usr/lib64/glib-2.0/
# include, holding glibconfig.h) do not exist inside the Debian sysroot,
# and the engine build dies with "glibconfig.h: No such file or directory".
# The sysroot only exists at gn time, so the fix is a PATH shim: whenever
# pkg-config is invoked with a sysroot-scoped PKG_CONFIG_PATH or
# PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR, pin both variables to the sysroot's real .pc
# directories (search stays inside the sysroot) and bridge the sysroot's
# missing usr/lib64 onto its real lib dir so lib64-style paths from stray
# Fedora .pc files still resolve. Non-scoped callers (Cargo, the settings
# CMake build) see an unmodified pass-through.

%changelog
* Tue Sep 10 2026 Sunny Yang <sunny@users.noreply.github.com> - 0.3.1-1
- Convert the Fedora adapter from a staged-binary spec to a true source
  build: %build now runs the canonical tools/denial-pc pipeline (lock-pinned
  Flutter fork bootstrap, gn/ninja engine artifacts, Flutter AOT shell and
  settings bundles, Cargo release build of the compositor) inside the chroot,
  and installs the payload trees staged by tools/stage-denial-runtime.
- denial-flutter-engine is a subpackage of this spec: the engine is
  compiled from the fork sources in the chroot (tools/denial-flutter-engine
  build) and the resulting, SHA-256-verified libflutter_engine.so is shipped
  by the subpackage; no external engine BuildRequire is needed.
* Wed Aug 12 2026 Doctor Logix <doctor.logix@gmail.com> - 0.3.1-1
- Add the native Fedora package adapter.
