# Install Denial

Denial publishes signed first-party x86-64 repositories for Arch Linux and
CachyOS, Debian 13 (trixie), Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (noble), and Fedora 44. Alpine
Linux 3.24 receives signed direct APK downloads from each GitHub Release;
NixOS 26.05 has a first-party source flake and module, and Void Linux is
runtime-tested without a first-party package. openSUSE Tumbleweed has a native
local RPM adapter but no published package lane yet. Every published binary
package set uses the permanent release-key fingerprint:

```text
AE4108FA5E91E26BE0EE331E0F5B3AD16E023091
```

ARM64 (AArch64) is fully supported, but first-party ARM64 binaries are not
published yet. ARM64 users should follow the [source build guide](BUILDING.md).

> [!WARNING]
> Denial does not guarantee compatibility with systems that were originally
> installed with KDE. KDE applications, background services, and desktop
> integrations left by a KDE installation can cause numerous issues in a
> Denial session.

For Arch, CachyOS, Debian, Ubuntu, or Fedora, review the repository-owned
[`install.sh`](../install.sh), then run:

```sh
sh -c 'if ! command -v curl >/dev/null 2>&1; then echo "Error: curl is not available." >&2; exit 1; fi; curl -fsSL https://install.denialwm.org | sh'
```

The setup script detects the supported distribution, downloads the public
key, derives and pins its complete fingerprint, rejects conflicting existing
configuration, and configures the native package manager. It asks before
using `sudo` and does not install Denial or any other package.

After repository setup, install Denial explicitly. Use only the command for
the current distribution.

### Arch Linux or CachyOS

```sh
sudo pacman -Syu denial
```

### Debian 13 or Ubuntu 24.04

```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt install denial
```

### Fedora 44

```sh
sudo dnf install denial
```

### openSUSE Tumbleweed

openSUSE currently has a source-to-local-RPM adapter rather than a published
Zypper repository or GitHub Release binary. Build the package pair with
`tools/denial-pc opensuse-package`, then install both local RPMs together.
See the [openSUSE package guide](../packaging/opensuse/README.md) for the build
requirements, output path, and command.

### Alpine Linux 3.24

Alpine is currently a direct-download lane rather than a native APK
repository. Replace `X.Y.Z` with the release version, verify both adjacent
OpenPGP signatures, and only then allow APK to install the locally verified
files:

```sh
version=X.Y.Z
release="https://github.com/denialwm/denial/releases/download/v$version"

doas apk add gnupg
curl -fLO https://denialwm.github.io/denial/denial-repo-key.asc
curl -fLO "$release/denial-flutter-engine-$version-r1.apk"
curl -fLO "$release/denial-flutter-engine-$version-r1.apk.sig"
curl -fLO "$release/denial-$version-r1.apk"
curl -fLO "$release/denial-$version-r1.apk.sig"

fingerprint="$(
  gpg --show-keys --with-colons denial-repo-key.asc \
    | awk -F: '$1 == "fpr" { print $10; exit }'
)"
test "$fingerprint" = AE4108FA5E91E26BE0EE331E0F5B3AD16E023091
gpg --import denial-repo-key.asc
gpg --verify "denial-flutter-engine-$version-r1.apk.sig" \
  "denial-flutter-engine-$version-r1.apk"
gpg --verify "denial-$version-r1.apk.sig" \
  "denial-$version-r1.apk"
doas apk add --allow-untrusted \
  "./denial-flutter-engine-$version-r1.apk" \
  "./denial-$version-r1.apk"
```

`--allow-untrusted` refers only to APK's native RSA trust format. The commands
above authenticate the exact files with Denial's pinned OpenPGP release key
before installation. A future native APK repository will remove this manual
boundary.

### NixOS 26.05

Use the in-repository package and `programs.denial` module. They build the
compositor, locked Flutter engine, shell, and Settings from source, register
the display-manager session and portals, and do not require `/usr/bin`
compatibility links. See the [NixOS installation guide](../packaging/nixos/README.md)
for the flake configuration and current architecture support.

The package manager installs the exactly compatible
`denial-flutter-engine` package as a dependency. The optional
`denial-ui-development` binary package is currently published only through
the Pacman repository.

## Repository trust paths

The guided setup installs these exact configurations:

- Arch Linux and CachyOS: `https://denialwm.github.io/denial/$arch`, with
  package and Pacman database signatures required through Pacman's trusted
  keyring;
- Debian 13: `https://denialwm.github.io/denial/apt`, suite `trixie`, component
  `main`, with `/etc/apt/keyrings/denial.asc` as `Signed-By`;
- Debian Forky/Sid: the Debian 13 `trixie` suite on a best-effort basis; this
  rolling target has not completed Denial's full runtime validation;
- Ubuntu 24.04: the same APT root, suite `noble`, component `main`, and the same
  scoped keyring;
- Fedora 44: `https://denialwm.github.io/denial/rpm/fedora/$releasever/$basearch`,
  with both `gpgcheck=1` for embedded RPM signatures and `repo_gpgcheck=1` for
  signed repository metadata;
- Alpine 3.24: versioned GitHub Release APKs with adjacent OpenPGP signatures;
  no APKINDEX is published yet.

APT authenticates the signed `InRelease`/`Release.gpg` metadata before using
its package checksums. DNF authenticates `repomd.xml` and the embedded OpenPGP
signature in each RPM header. Adjacent detached signatures and the signed
top-level `SHA256SUMS` remain available for direct-download verification.

## Updates and removal

Use the native package manager's normal full update path:

```sh
# Arch Linux or CachyOS
sudo pacman -Syu

# Debian or Ubuntu
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

# Fedora
sudo dnf upgrade

# Alpine: repeat the verified direct-download procedure above.
```

Remove Denial with `sudo pacman -Rns denial`, `sudo apt remove denial`, or
`sudo dnf remove denial`; on Alpine use `doas apk del denial`. Removing the
package does not remove repository configuration or imported verification
keys.

The [Arch-specific guide](packaging/arch/INSTALL.md) documents manual Pacman
keyring setup, configuration inspection, the optional development package,
and session validation in more detail.

## Release trust

Public-beta packages are built on Denial's owner-operated x86-64 runner and
signed in a separate GitHub-hosted job. The tag workflow promotes the retained
`main` payload without compiling it again, creates the three native repository
formats plus direct Alpine APKs, and secret-free publication jobs exercise
APT, DNF, and APK clients against the exact signed snapshot before deployment.
This proves release
authorization and repository integrity, not offline closure, reproducibility,
independent rebuilding, SBOM coverage, or AArch64 binary packages. See
[Build trust](BUILD_TRUST.md) for the exact claims.
