# Denial build trust

Denial publishes only claims supported by its current evidence. The signed
public beta prioritizes ordinary installation, verified updates, and
transparent build ownership. Complete offline closure and independent
reproducibility remain later goals. The project does not treat a CI badge,
package signature, or maintainer-owned builder as proof that a binary is safe.

## Current status

As of 2026-08-21:

- the x86-64 source-built Flutter Engine and split Pacman package prototype
  have passed source reconstruction, tests, package transactions, and
  real-hardware validation;
- Denial 0.1.0 was published through the signed-tag workflow and installed
  successfully from the signed first-party Pages repository;
- the permanent release identity
  `AE4108FA5E91E26BE0EE331E0F5B3AD16E023091` is backed up and its signing
  subkey is installed in the GitHub `release-signing` environment;
- the v0.2.0 candidate path adds the separately versioned and optional
  `denial-ui-development` package to the same build, signing, verification,
  repository, and release-evidence boundary;
- the release candidate also emits byte-identical Debian-family and Fedora
  runtime/engine pairs from one GLIBC-gated staging tree; the signed-tag path
  republishes those exact payloads through signed APT and DNF repositories and
  as signed GitHub Release downloads without compiling them again;
- the same CachyOS runner builds Alpine APKs in a checksum-pinned, rootless
  Alpine 3.24.1 minirootfs, retains the adapted musl/gcompat payload, and lets
  the tag workflow repackage it without compilation; the first-party APKs are
  OpenPGP-signed direct downloads rather than a native APK repository;
- no Stage 1 development or disposable-key package is presented as a public
  release;
- complete offline dependency closure and package reproducibility remain
  Stage 2 and Stage 3 work;
- the dedicated x86-64 host, locked runner account, and manually armed
  one-job GitHub registration have passed local and live registration tests;
- ARM64 (AArch64) is a fully supported runtime architecture, but it is not yet
  a first-party binary release architecture.

The detailed evidence is in
[the package validation report](packaging/arch/VALIDATION.md). The remaining
work and release gates are in
[the publishing design](packaging/arch/PUBLISHING.md).

## Builder disclosure

The initial x86-64 release builder is a dedicated CachyOS laptop owned and
operated by the Denial maintainer. CachyOS is the host; a recreated clean Arch
environment must become the Stage 2 package build authority. The machine is
manually armed for one trusted `dev` or `main` build at a time. It never
executes pull-request, fork, signing, or publication jobs.

Machine ownership is disclosed rather than presented as an assurance. The
builder is one trust domain, so two builds on that machine can demonstrate
determinism but not independent reproduction.

For the public beta, the builder must:

- run as a dedicated unprivileged account;
- receive no production signing key;
- be registered as an ephemeral one-job GitHub runner;
- retain no credentials or writable build environment after the job;
- accept only a reviewed trusted-branch revision after the operator explicitly
  arms it;
- run the compositor and Flutter tests before packaging;
- publish the exact source revision, host package inventory, logs, manifests,
  `.BUILDINFO`, and artifact hashes.

Stage 2 and Stage 3 additionally require recreated clean Arch environments,
declared dependency acquisition, network-disabled compilation, and
reproducibility work. The public beta states plainly that it has not reached
those gates.

The implemented host uses a locked `denial-builder` account, a checksum-pinned
official runner, a static hardened systemd service, and an ephemeral
repository-scoped registration. It stores neither a GitHub PAT nor a signing
key. See [the builder runbook](packaging/arch/BUILDER.md).

## What each proof means

| Evidence | Establishes | Does not establish |
|---|---|---|
| OpenPGP package signature | Denial approved these exact bytes | The bytes match public source |
| GitHub artifact attestation | A public workflow associated a digest with a repository, revision, and event | The self-hosted machine was uncompromised |
| Clean offline build | Compilation used the declared local closure rather than fetching ambient inputs | The builder was honest |
| Same-builder double build | The inputs appear deterministic in fresh local environments | Independent agreement |
| Independent byte-identical rebuild | Another trust domain produced the same bytes from the published inputs | That the reviewed source has no vulnerability |

No individual item replaces the others.

## Public-beta release evidence

Every public-beta release publishes:

- a signed, immutable source tag;
- literal package metadata (Arch and Alpine `.PKGINFO`, Arch `.BUILDINFO`,
  Debian control fields, and RPM identity fields);
- the source revision, runner disclosure, compiler and Flutter versions, host
  package inventory, test logs, Namcap output, and artifact hashes;
- embedded or detached OpenPGP signatures for packages and signed Pacman,
  APT and DNF repository metadata, plus direct Alpine APKs;
- a signed complete SHA-256 manifest;
- the full public key and fingerprint;
- explicit non-claims for offline closure, reproducibility, independent
  rebuilding, SBOMs, and AArch64 binary packages.

Beginning with v0.2.0, the signed package set contains three Arch archives:
one `denial-flutter-engine`, one `denial`, and one optional
`denial-ui-development`; it also contains a `denial-flutter-engine`/`denial`
pair for Debian-family systems and another pair for Fedora. The development
archive remains available only through Pacman and is not installed by default.
The set also contains a `denial-flutter-engine`/`denial` APK pair for Alpine
3.24. Those APKs have adjacent OpenPGP signatures; APK-native RSA signatures
and an APKINDEX are not claimed yet.
Every archive takes its package identity directly from the verified signed tag. The
engine's `denial-flutter-engine-abi` capability is an independent
compatibility contract; its one-time epoch only preserves Pacman ordering
across the transition from the former Flutter-numbered package. Arch packages
and repository databases and every direct download receive an adjacent
detached OpenPGP signature. APT additionally authenticates
`InRelease`/`Release.gpg`, while DNF authenticates signed `repomd.xml` and the
embedded signature in each RPM header.

Stage 2 and Stage 3 later add immutable source/tool closures, generated
`.SRCINFO`, normalized compiler and linker manifests, SBOMs, attestations,
debug information, and reproducibility results that distinguish same-builder
from independent verification.

The signing identity is separate from the builder. Package files are immutable:
an already published `pkgver-pkgrel` is never silently replaced.

## Independent verification

The eventual independent verification path is:

```sh
git verify-tag vX.Y.Z
git checkout vX.Y.Z
cd packaging/arch
makerepropkg /path/to/denial-X.Y.Z-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst
```

This command is not yet a public-beta claim: the current PKGBUILD consumes
cache-backed build outputs. It becomes a release gate only after Stage 2
replaces those inputs with a complete immutable closure.

Until an external rebuilder exists, Denial will report:

```text
same-builder reproducible: yes|no
independently reproduced:  yes|no
```

It will never call two builds performed by the owner-operated machine
“independent.”

## Workflow policy

The public GitHub workflows are part of the reviewable build instructions:

- no `pull_request` trigger targets a Denial-owned runner;
- manual builder qualification runs only from `main`;
- `dev` candidates are never releasable;
- `main` independently builds and verifies the production candidate before a
  public version is chosen;
- release jobs require a clean signed `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` tag contained in
  public `main` and promote only the retained exact-commit production payload;
- signed-tag jobs perform no compilation;
- workflow permissions default to read-only;
- build jobs have no package-signing or release-publication secret; the only
  publication credential is a per-cache Cachix token scoped to Nix outputs;
- a separate `release-signing` environment receives only the secret subkey;
- publication re-verifies the signed tree without any secret key, exercises
  isolated APT and DNF clients, and publishes the draft GitHub Release only
  after Pages deployment succeeds;
- the release page exposes every signed Arch, Debian-family, and Fedora
  package together with its detached signature and the signed complete
  checksum manifest.

`tools/denial-release` implements the machine and source audits used by those
workflows. Passing a development source audit is necessary but is not
authorization to publish; only the manual signed-tag release path can do so.
